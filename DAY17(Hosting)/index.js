/*Js code execution
Js is a synchronous single threaded language.

Hosting in  javascript is the behavior where variable and function declarations are 
moved to the top  of their comtaining scope during  the compilation phase, before 
 the code  has been executed.
 That means the javascript "hoists" or lifts the declaration
